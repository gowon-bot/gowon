## Running yourself

Gowon now uses Docker and Docker Compose to run. She still accesses the database on the host machine however, so ensure you have Postgres installed, and a database called `gowon` exists (`createdb gowon`).

Copy `config.example.json` to `config.json`, and fill in all the fields. Then, do the same with `ormconfig.example.json`.

If you want to run a development version of the bot, you can create a `docker-compose.yml.override` to specify exposed ports and a development Dockerfile (where you could setup auto-reload with nodemon).

To start docker-compose, run `docker-compose up`. Note you will have to download and build the Mirrorball docker image. (Available at [gowon-bot/lilac](https://github.com/gowon-bot/lilac))

## Commands list

_You can find the source code for all the commands at [/src/commands](/src/commands)_
